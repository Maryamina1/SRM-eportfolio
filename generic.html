									<h1> Final Reflection<br />
									</h1>
									<p> In completion of the Security and Risk Management module, I am reflecting on the valuable skills and knowledge I have gained throughout this journey. With particular focus on the digitalisation and risk management project to which I will embarked on a comprehensive and enlightening journey, providing valuable insights into the complexities of transitioning a business, Pampered Pets, into the digital era. As I reflect on the project using Rolfe et al.'s (2001) approach - WHAT, SO WHAT, NOW WHAT - I delve into the key aspects of the project and the personal and collective learning experiences.<br />

								<p>WHAT: 
									The overall project aimed to assist Pampered Pets, in digitalising its operations and expanding internationally while mitigating potential risks. In the first assignment as a team, we conducted a risk identification report and for the individual assignment I was responsible for completing an executive summary. Both assignments required thorough risk assessment using both qualitative and quantitative methodologies. The focus was on identifying risks associated with online security, supply chain management, customer retention, and operational efficiency. 
									
								</h1>
								<p> SO WHAT: Emotional Response and Analysis
									Emotionally, navigating the complexities of digitalisation and risk management required a balance between optimism and caution. The realisation of the substantial impact these decisions could have on a business's future heightened the importance of thorough analysis and strategic planning. 
									
									Reviewing the literature on cybersecurity, supply chain management, and digitalisation models was crucial in shaping a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities. One of the challenges I encountered was the limited availability of data for the quantitative risk assessment. Navigating through this constraint required creativity in identifying potential risks and relying on expert opinions and cyber security threats from a broad and general perspective. This challenge highlighted the importance of adaptability and resourcefulness in the risk management process.
									
									In completion of the group assignment balancing individual tasks with collaborative efforts posed a challenge. It required careful time management and coordination to ensure that each team member's contributions were integrated seamlessly into the essays. Unfortunately, within my team of three, a particular individual did not provide any support of input into the assignment. Efforts were made to keep them on board and integrate their ideas into the final submission however they failed to engage. This placed an additional burden on the remaining members who had to pick up the slack. As a result, our group had to adapt and reassign responsibilities to ensure the completion of the assignment. This adaptive process, while challenging, highlighted the resilience and commitment of the remaining team members. It is noteworthy that this unexpected imbalance in workload led to increased stress and had the potential to diminish the overall quality of our work however luckily it did not. Nonetheless, active participation, from myself in team discussions has improved my own collaboration skills and learning to work collectively towards a common goal has enhanced my ability to contribute meaningfully within a team setting.
									
								
								</h1>	
								<p>NOW WHAT: Learning and Changed Actions
									This project has significantly contributed to my learning and professional development. Firstly, understanding the importance of a qualitative risk assessment in situations with limited data has broadened my perspective on risk management strategies. Incorporating methodologies like the STRIDE model for threat modelling highlighted the need for a targeted and appropriate approach in addressing security vulnerabilities (Shevchenko et al., 2018).
									
									Moreover, the emphasis on secure website development, strong authentication, secure payment processing, and data encryption as mitigation strategies has heightened my awareness of the critical role cybersecurity plays in digitalisation. Recognising the global trend towards e-commerce, as highlighted by Statista (2022), has emphasised the importance of adapting to customer preferences.
									
									The exploration of qualitative and quantitative risk assessment methods in this module has significantly broadened my knowledge in the field of security and risk management. Understanding the importance of both approaches equips me with a well-rounded understanding of risk assessment techniques. The module assignments have also provided insights into the complexities of digitalisation and the potential risks associated with it. Engaging in the risk identification, assessment, and mitigation process has significantly contributed to the enhancement of my skills in this domain. The analysis of risks and the formulation of mitigation strategies in the essays have provided a practical application of theoretical knowledge. The quantitative risk assessment using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) in the executive summary showcased the importance of a systematic evaluation of multiple criteria and the prioritisation of risks. The integration of diverse criteria in a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach, as suggested by Çelikbilek and Tüysüz (2020), highlighted the complexity of decision-making in a real-world scenario. This hands-on experience has played a pivotal role in my educational development, enabling me to approach risk management with confidence.
									
									For me, the experience as a team member has contributed to the development of a better understanding of risk management within a team context. Collaborating with diverse perspectives and skill sets has broadened my approach to problem-solving and decision-making. The growth in teamwork skills is invaluable for future collaborative endeavours. Being part of a team provided insights into diverse perspectives and approaches. Each team member brought unique insights to the table, enriching the overall quality of the essay. This diversity in thinking allowed for a more comprehensive and well-rounded analysis. The exploration of cybersecurity, risk management, and digitalization has expanded my knowledge in these critical areas. Understanding the intricacies of online security, supply chain risks, and the impact of digitalization on businesses has provided a comprehensive view of the challenges and opportunities in today's evolving landscape.
									
									
								</h1>
								<p>In conclusion, the digitalization and risk management project for Pampered Pets have been a significant learning experience. The integration of theoretical knowledge with practical application, the recognition of emotional aspects, and the collaborative teamwork have collectively contributed to a holistic understanding of the project dynamics. As I move forward, the insights gained from this project will guide me in approaching future challenges with a more strategic, empathetic, and informed perspective. The exploration of qualitative and quantitative risk assessment methods, active participation in team activities, and the application of risk management strategies have collectively contributed to a more comprehensive understanding of the field. The experiences gained in this process have not only expanded my knowledge but have also enhanced my skills in collaboration, critical thinking, and effective communication. Moving forward, these reflections will serve as a foundation for future endeavours, reinforcing the importance of adaptability, teamwork, and a holistic approach to security and risk management.
